# Beginning Career Code Challenges

First of all, thank you for dedicating time on doing this code challenge.

We aim to help you as much as possible to have a good experience during the interview process. In case you find yourself lost in some step, please, contact your person of contact.

## What do we expect?

We don't aim you to spend a large amount of time to the Katas we share with you here, we aim to understand your current level so that we can adapt ourselves to the initial support that you will need when you join Creditas.

Be in the beginning of your software career doesn't mean you need to understand everything!

## What will we look for in the code?

We will look for:

- Be able to follow the code and understand what the code does
- The code accomplish, somehow, the specification and it's easy to verify its behavior (running the tests for example)
- You have some notion about testing, or at least you tried to make the tests to work
- In case you think we might not understand some part, feel free to add comments.

## Do we expect it to be perfect?

__NO!__.

## How to start?

Look at this video.
