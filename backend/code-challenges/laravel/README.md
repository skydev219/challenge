# Code Challenge

The assessment proposal which we'll develop together is provide a person with the loan types suitable for her, given some variables:

We must provide the following loan types:

- Personal Loan. Interest Rate: 4%
- Collateralized Loan. Interest Rate: 3%
- Payroll Loan. Interest Rate: 2%

Listed below are the business rules for conceding a loan based on the person's profile:

|                          | Personal Loan | Collateralized Loan | Payroll |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | :-----------------: | ------- |
| Income <= 3000           | Yes           |       Yes\*\*\*     | No      |
| Income > 3000 & < 5000   | Yes           |        Yes\*\*      | No      |
| Income => 5000           | Yes           |         Yes\*       | Yes     |

- \* Clients under 30 y.o.
- \*\* Clients residing in SP (SÃ£o Paulo state code in Brazil)
- \*\*\* Clients under 30 y.o. residing in SP

```

## Before the interview
- Since this will be a pair programming interview, make sure that you'll be able to share your screen on Google Meet
- Set up the project on your language of choice. The instructions are inside the respective folders. This will save precious minutes during the interview.
- Take your time and become familiar with the challenge, files and project structure

## During the interview
- This challenge will be tackled alongside our crew, in a pair programming dynamic
- This pair programming dynamic tries to simulate the crew's day-to-day practices, so feel free to raise any question, ask for suggestions, etc. There is no right or wrong, we're only interested in understanding how you approach problems!

## After the interview
- The code written during this interview is confidential, and MUST NOT be shared with anyone other than our crew.


# Configuration & Installation

## Prerequisites
Docker or php version `8.1.0` and node `v16.17.0` installed.

We recommend using Laravel Sail to run the project.

### Using sail on Mac/Linux/Wsl2

```bash
    docker run --rm \
        -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
        -w /var/www/html \
        laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
        composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
        
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    
```

If you aren't using sail or docker, you can use the following commands to run the project:

### Installing without docker/sail

We use `composer` as the php package manager.

To install on Mac and Linux:
```sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer
```

To install on Windows:
Download [https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) and follow all steps.


To install the packages:

```sh
composer install
```

### Runing the project

```bash
php artisan serve
```
