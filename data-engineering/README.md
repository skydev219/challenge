# Creditas Data Engineering Challenge

## Introduction

Hi! We're glad to know you intend to work with us in the Creditas Data Engineering team. It means a lot you're taking time to do this programming assignment! :smiley:

This challenge mimics a task we ourselves deal with on a daily basis and it was designed to asses your coding skills. We expect you to deliver a professional solution, taking into account correctness, performance and code organization. :nerd_face:

## The problem: digital media effectiveness

### A little bit on digital marketing

Digital Marketing is all about attracting new customers using online tools, such as facebook, google search, LinkedIn, and others. All these platforms provide paid capabilities for companies willing to advertise their products to potential customers. In short, digital marketing is just like traditional marketing but using digital media instead of physical ones (like newspaper, magazines, outdoors). Also, a key difference between them is that with digital media is possible to track user engagement and adjust the marketing strategy accordingly, optimizing the money spent with marketing.

This challenge is about preparing data to analyze digital media effectivenes on our business. If you know nothing about digital marketing that's fine, you're not supposed to and previous knowledge in this matter is not needed. Here are some of the key digital marketing concepts:

 - *Campaign*: a marketing campaign is a series of coordinated advertising actions intended to target a specific group of potential customers;
 - *Ad Creative*: a graphical image or video that conveys the message being advertised;
 - *Ad Impressions*: one single occurrence of displaying an ad to a potential customer;
 - *Clicks*: one single click on the ad that leads the customer to the company's website;

### Creditas conversion funnel

We can look at the path the customers goes from getting to know a company to converting into a customer as a funnel. It is a funnel because for each further step we look, we will progressively find less people involved. The following image illustrates a very simplified version of the conversion funnel we have here in Creditas.

Initially the customer is unaware of our product, the goal of digital marketing is attract potential customers into the conversion funnel. After the customer fills out a lead form (that means he/she is interested), we will run the credit analysis and then formalize the operation signing the contract.

The operation may not be completed by many reasons, such as:
 - the customer is not approved in credit analysis;
 - the customer is suspected of being a fraud;
 - the customer loses interest and quits the process.

### The data

There are 4 different datasets to handle and *integrate*. They are all made up, it's not real data.

#### `google_ads_media_costs.jsonl`

This dataset contains ad campaign costs from Google Ads Platform, one json string per line.

Line example:

```json
{
    "date": "2018-10-01",
    "google_campaign_id": 1001,
    "google_campaign_name": "emprestimo_garantia|auto|natal2018",
    "ad_creative_id": 20001,
    "ad_creative_name": "homem_sorrindo_fundo_carro_012",
    "clicks": 3979,
    "impressions": 157767,
    "cost": 20.4
}
```

#### `facebook_ads_media_costs.jsonl`

This dataset contains ad campaign costs from Facebook Ads Platform, one json string per line. It is very similar to the previous, but *do not provide the ad creative id* information.

Line example:

```json
{
    "date": "2018-10-01",
    "fb_campaign_id": 3001,
    "fb_campaign_name": "emprestimo_garantia|auto|natal2018",
    "clicks": 2265,
    "impressions": 397781,
    "cost": 246.78
}
```

#### `pageviews.txt`

This file comes from the webserver logs and provide pageviews information about a customer visiting our website. It is a purely text file so to extract information from it you have to parse each line and capture just what is needed.

Line example:

```txt
203.0.181.219 - [2018-10-01 00:00:00] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 http://www.creditas.com.br/emprestimo-com-garantia?ad_creative_id=20003&campaign_id=1002 | device_id: mmRe2Qts07 | referer: http://google.com.br
192.0.5.86 - [2018-10-01 00:00:00] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 http://www.bankfacil.com.br/emprestimo-com-garantia?campaign_id=3005 | device_id: i2IJLNavik | referer: http://www.facebook.com
192.14.66.90 - [2018-10-01 00:15:00] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 http://www.bankfacil.com.br/emprestimo-com-garantia | device_id: Pk9yEGx715 | referer: https://www.moreira.br/

```

From the URL address you can find the `ad_creative_id` and the `campaign_id`. Also the `referer` indicates where it came from, whether from Google Ads (`http://google.com.br`), Facebook Ads (`http://www.facebook.com`) or organic traffic (anything else).

#### `customer_leads_funnel.csv`

This file represents a copy of a analytical table that already exists in our environment.

| device_id  | lead_id   | registered_at       | credit_decision | credit_decision_at  | signed_at           | revenue  |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| 3HTZRCZdLc | 578419657 | 2018-10-01 00:00:50 | A               | 2018-10-05 19:37:50 |                     |          |
| Mr35TsBJtE | 581565131 | 2018-10-01 00:10:22 | D               | 2018-10-01 10:17:22 |                     |          |
| 1ZBFWuW5Qd | 100080974 | 2018-10-01 01:32:12 | A               | 2018-10-04 21:00:12 | 2018-10-07 01:59:12 | 19340.61 |

Keep in mind that "lead" is an interested person, which may or may not become a customer. The _lead_ becomes a customer when he/she signs the contract.

Please note that in the column `credit_decision`, an `A` stands for *Approved* and a `D` stands for *Denied*. Also, you will notice that even if a customer is approved he/she may give up and don't sign the contract; which, in turn, will generate no revenue.

### What the user needs to answer

The digital marketing team is a highly data driven and results oriented team. They need you to prepare the analytical database/tables where they will perform queries to answer the following business questions:

1. What was the most expensive campaign?
2. What was the most profitable campaign?
3. Which ad creative is the most effective in terms of clicks?
4. Which ad creative is the most effective in terms of generating leads?

### What you need to do

Using `python` and other tools of your choice:
 - ingest the data in a database;
 - provide a single table ready to be used to answer the questions above;
 - provide 4 SQL queries in your README that are answers for each business question presented above;
 - explain how to reproduce your solution;

We expect you to understand the data, how the datasets fit together and how to best store/represent data to the end data user.

### How to deliver your solution

Create a github private repository and grant access to the user `challenge-dadinho`. Please also reply the original e-mail with the link to this page informing you submitted your solution.
